# freeCodeCamp Machine Learning Projects

This repository serves as a hub for all my **freeCodeCamp: Machine Learning with Python** assignments.  
Each project is maintained in its own repository and is linked below with a brief description of what it does.

## Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Cat vs Dog Image Classifier](https://github.com/jmacaben/fcc-cat-dog) | A convolutional neural network trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. |
| [Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/jmacaben/fcc-book-rec) | Recommends books based on user preferences using collaborative filtering with K-Nearest Neighbors. |
| [Health Costs Calculator](https://github.com/jmacaben/fcc-health-costs) | Predicts individual healthcare costs based on personal features using regression models. Involves converting categorical data to numbers, splitting the dataset for training and testing, and using a sequential neural network to estimate healthcare expenses.|
| [SMS Text Classifier](https://github.com/jmacaben/fcc-sms-text) | Classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam. Includes preprocessing of text, converting messages into numerical sequences, and using a Bidirectional LSTM to understand context. |
| [Rock-Paper-Scissors Game](https://github.com/jmacaben/fcc-rps-game) | Implements a higher-order Markov model to beat four different bots at Rock-Paper-Scissors at least 60% of the time. Tracks patterns in opponent moves and predicts their next move, allowing the program to select the optimal counter. |
